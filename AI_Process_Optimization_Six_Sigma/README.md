Project Title: AI-Enabled Process Optimization using Six Sigma

Objective:
To demonstrate how AI can be applied within a Six Sigma framework to optimize business processes and improve operational efficiency.

Business Problem:
Manual business reporting processes are time-consuming and prone to delays. This project applies AI-assisted improvements using the DMAIC methodology.

Methodology:
Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)

Work Performed:
- Analyzed an existing reporting process
- Identified inefficiencies and root causes
- Proposed AI-enabled process improvements
- Defined control mechanisms and success metrics

Outcome:
Presented a structured AI-driven process optimization approach suitable for business and analytics teams.
